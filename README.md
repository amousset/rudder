### Is Rudder open-source?

dev model vs source license



In an open-core model, like Elastic, some portion of the product is free, but the premium version or add-ons are licensed with a commercial license. (Think community edition vs. enterprise edition.) "Here an open-source vendor's biggest competitor is usually its free version," said Kellogg.



The team behind Rudder believes in open-source and free software importance for ...
We strive to open-source as much code as possible, without losing project viability.

In addition to open-sources libraries and basic tool, we also chose to keep the base product open. This means there the packages available to community users are the same as the packages provided to subscription users, with the same QA and security processes. This is not a 2-speed model, but a "2-scope" model.
There is only one code base.

To sum things up, Rudder has an open-core model

#### CLA

We need a signed individual or entity CLA (Contributor License Agreement) before we can merge any code or documentation to Rudder.

Why require a CLA:

* Allow us to enforce the license: in general, only the copyright holder or someone having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license of a program.
* Provide clear
* Give us options for the future. This already allowed us to relicense Rudder from AGLv3 to GPLv3.

Given the recent developments in the legal framework surrounding patents, copyrights and their use, we want to be very clear about what we give and wait in return before we can accept a contribution. We want to be able to evolve with all these legal issues, and be able to defend the project if something unpleasant happens, or simply if a contributor changes their mind. Prevention is better than cure!

* If you are making a personal contribution, here is the reference text to consult: [individual CLA](https://sign.signable.app/widget/xs2adbWSXS).
* If you are contributing on behalf of a company, consult this version: [entity CLA](https://sign.signable.app/#/widget/4YpYMVZKWG).

In summary (but you should really read the full text, because it alone has legal value), you state that:

* your contribution is voluntary,
* your work is your original creation,
* you grant a copyright license for your contributions to Normation, the software publisher that develops Rudder in the legal and administrative sense,
* you grant a patent license for your contributions to Normation,
* you are not required to provide support for your contributions.

Our text is based on the CLA provided by the Harmony Agreement Project. The HARMONY agreements are a community group focused on contribution agreements for free and open source software (FOSS).
