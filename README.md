## What is Rudder?

System infrastructure automation for operational security

Leader in IT operational security automation for critical productions.
Empowering Ops teams to ensure cyber-resilience
and foster SecOps collaboration.

Rudder is a configuration and security automation platform. Manage your Cloud, hybrid or on-premise infrastructure in a simple, scalable and dynamic way.

This is the primary repository of the Rudder project, containing the core component of the [Rudder platform](https://www.rudder.io).

A Rudder installation is made of:

* A central server
* (optional) relays that act as smart proxies
* A light agent installed on every managed node

## FAQ

### Is Rudder open-source? Is it free?

Rudder has an _open-core_ model:

* Rudder _core_ is available for free and totally open-source (under GPLv3 an Apache 2.0). It includes the main Rudder components, Linux agents, plus several plugins.
* The complete Rudder solution is paid and partially open-source. A part of the paid plugins and agents are distributed under proprietary license.
   It also includes other ... like long-term support, support for a wider set of operating systems, support, etc. It is part of a subscription and includes:
  * Additionnal plugins that add major features
  * Support for older versions on Linux distributions
  * Support for aditionnal architecures (ARM & Power)
  * Support for proprietary operating systems: Windows and AIX
  * Extended support (see FAQ)
  * User support

We are strong believers in the merits of free / open-source software, and have turned to open-core to ensure the perenity of the project
(i.e. pay the developers).
Rudder is developped by a profesional team, 

We strive to open-source as much code as possible, without threatening the project viability.

Contrary to a lot of other tools, we made the decision to keep the the Web interface free of access.

### What are the differences between Rudder Core and the full Rudder solution?

* Rudder _core_ is a versatile automation engine for pretty recent Linux systems,
thought to give access to ... to small organizations and indivudals
* Rudder is an multiplatform operational security solution
matching the current needs of ... (based on Rudder _core_).

Main traction to conÔ¨Åguration management
enabling small businesses and individuals to
start their journey in cyber-resilience.

There are no separate solution, the free version is identical to the core of the full solution.

subscription users, with the same QA and security processes. This is not a two-speed model, but
a "two-scope" model.

## Contributing 

### How can I get involved with the Rudder project?

We are open to contributions, and development is made in the open.

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including code, documentation, examples of Rudder use cases,
feedback about your usage, etc.

### Contributor License Agreement

We need a signed individual or entity CLA (Contributor License Agreement) before we can merge any code or documentation to Rudder.
We decided to ask for a CLA to:

* Allow us to enforce the license: in general, only the copyright holder or someone having assignment of the copyright can enforce the license of a program.
* Give us options for the future. For example, this allowed us to relicense Rudder from AGLv3 to GPLv3 to facilitate its adoption.

Given the recent developments in the legal framework surrounding patents, copyrights and their use, we want to be very clear about what we give and wait in return before we can accept a contribution. We want to be able to evolve with all these legal issues, and be able to defend the project if something unpleasant happens, or simply if a contributor changes their mind. Prevention is better than cure!

* If you are making a personal contribution, here is the reference text to consult: [individual CLA](https://sign.signable.app/widget/xs2adbWSXS).
* If you are contributing on behalf of a company, consult this version: [entity CLA](https://sign.signable.app/#/widget/4YpYMVZKWG).

In summary (but you should really read the full text, because it alone has legal value), you state that:

* your contribution is voluntary,
* your work is your original creation,
* you grant a copyright license for your contributions to Normation, the software publisher that develops Rudder in the legal and administrative sense,
* you grant a patent license for your contributions to Normation,
* you are not required to provide support for your contributions.

Our text is based on the CLA provided by the [Harmony Agreement Project](https://www.harmonyagreements.org/). The Harmony agreements are a community group focused on contribution agreements for free and open source software (FOSS).
